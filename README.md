# Qubit-Simulator

## Plan
The plan is to build an **MVP** (Minimal Viable Product) of a Quantum Computer Simulation.
This simulation needs to be able to simulate and execute a handful of Qubits on a selection of Quantum Gates.
The simulation must be at-least optimized enough to be able to simulate single-digit number of Qubits on consumer-grade Laptops.


## Progress

### Classes / Structure

* [x] `Complex`: a class to store complex number
* [ ] `QubitRegister`: Manages a Qubit-Register, and stores the state vector for that Qubit. 
* [ ] `Gate`: An abstract class for gates, it must have a pure virtual function for `apply()`.
  * [ ] `HadmardGate`
  * [ ] `CNOTGate`
  * [ ] `PauliXGate` 
* [ ] `GateFactory`: It stores and manages all objects of `Gate`
* [ ] `Circuit`: a class to manage a `GateFactory` and (maybe multiple) `QubitRegister` objects. Needed to sequentially execute the `QubitRegister` on the list of `Gate`.

### Algorithms

* [ ] **Superposition**: Apply `HadmardGate` to a zero-state. 
* [ ] **Entanglement**: Apply `HadmardGate` to a qubit, then `CNOTGate` to observe its effects.
* [ ] **Measurement**: Implement a function that collapses the state based on probabilities.

## How to use
